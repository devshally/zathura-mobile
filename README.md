# Custom-Mono-Repo
A custom mono repo that is used to access recurring features and services used in Flutter app development. I'm building this repo with the aim of creating a high standard required by the industry to create stable, mainatable applications as well as speed up the process of development by reducing boiler plates and needlessly reinventing the wheel.

I will ensure this repo is constantly maintained and well documented. Feel free to contribute to the code or documentation by creating a pull request and if you find this project useful do start it.
